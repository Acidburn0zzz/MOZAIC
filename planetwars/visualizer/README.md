# Planetwars Visualiser

This repository is a visualiser for the Planetwars game as a React component in an NPM package. You should be able to import this package and use the library as any other component.

## Development

You can test this module with the code in the `bin` directory, which you can run with `yarn run dev`. This will spawn a webpack dev server which serves a basic wrapper around the visualizer which lets you upload a logfile.

## TODO

- Add color props
