# Feature list
This list is a conceptual collection of features we would like to support eventually.
Note that this list might not ever be complete and applies no ordering or priority on the listed features.

## Local play
Allowing players to compete on the local network, eliminating the need for internet connectivity or an intermediary server.

## Networked play
Players should be able to compete versus others registered on our network.

### Player challenging
Players should be able to challenge others on the network in friendly spirit. A player can choose to build a lobby in which he could invite friends and start a match independent of our own matchmaking.

### Automatic matchmaking
When players indicate they are ready to play a game, we should match against like minded players when these are available.

## Interchangeable rule sets
Games should be able to be swapped out on the fly in this infrastructure.

## Multiple rule sets
Multiple rule sets should be available at the same time, allowing players to pick whichever game they prefer.

## Multiple players
It should be a possibility to write rule sets for multiple players, and as such, our infrastructure should support it.

## Ranked environment
We could rate and rank players when they play games adding a global competition aspect.

Depends on: networked play.
