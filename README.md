MOZAIC is the Massive Online Zeus Artificial Intelligence Competition platform.
It aims to provide a flexible platform to host your very own AI competition. Just plug your game, and off you go!

Eventually MOZAIC should be very modular, so that you can provide a custom-tailored experience for your competitors, without having to worry about the heavy lifting.

# Features
For now MOZAIC is still in its early stages, but at Zeus WPI we're already getting it ready to support our own AI competition. As the platfrom matures, our specific usecase will be factored out and more features will be added.

Current and planned features:
 - [ ] Generic over game rules
   - [ ] implemented in Rust
   - [ ] ...
 - [ ] Game logging
 - [ ] Visualizers for your game
 - [ ] Uploading bots
    - [ ] Python or something
    - [ ] Any language, really
